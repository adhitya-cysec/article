4. **Disecting Lokibot Malware - Mengupas Teknik Canggih Lokibot Malware dan Menguak Hidden-Malware di Baliknya - In Bahasa Indonesia**
   - Recently, I conducted a malware analysis on Lokibot and discovered it employs sophisticated anti-forensic techniques, significantly challenging researchers attempting reverse engineering. Despite these hurdles, I successfully managed to extract the fileless malware, paving the way for further in-depth analysis. The hash of the concealed malware often evades detection by standard security products, rendering signature-based defenses ineffective. This underscores the necessity of utilizing solutions equipped with sandboxing capabilities or behavioral analysis to combat such threats effectively. You can find my detailed article on Kumparan.com, although it is in Indonesian. May you discover something enriching, for learning is our daily voyage of growth.

5. **A Tech Story Telling Series: The Espionage Campaign - Kaspersky, iPhones, and U.S. Intelligence**
   - Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) accused U.S. intelligence of hacking thousands of iPhones, including diplomats' devices, in an espionage campaign. They claim Apple collaborated with U.S. hackers, which Apple denies. Kaspersky Lab reported iPhones running iOS 15.7 were infected by file-stealing malware through zero-click iMessage attacks, although Kaspersky found no proof of U.S. involvement. The attack involved a remote code execution vulnerability, allowing privileged malware installation, and was dubbed "Operation Triangulation." Apple denied working with any government to insert backdoors into its products. This story draws from past reports in Security Week and The Washington Post, but the intrigue still lingers. I‚Äôve woven a tech-focused narrative around the events, blending facts with deeper analysis, and turned it into a captivating piece of storytelling. You can read the full story in this article. I hope you find the story enjoyable!
